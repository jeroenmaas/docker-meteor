Meteor for Docker
=================

This is a simple Meteor Docker image with support for live development and automated project building.

Built on the [NodeJS](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/) image, it lets you run and build Meteor apps without having to install the Meteor tool itself.

## What can I do with Meteor?

Meteor is a tool used to quickly build web and mobile applications.

The platform is based around JavaScript, in the front-end as well as in the back-end.  
Data is passed reactively from the server to the clients, and vice-versa.
