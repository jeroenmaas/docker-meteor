Meteor for Docker
=================

LATEST: [![build status](https://git.larsvanherk.com/docker-images/meteor/badges/master/build.svg)](https://git.larsvanherk.com/docker-images/meteor/commits/master)

This is a simple Meteor Docker image with support for live development and automated project building.

Built on the [NodeJS](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/) image, it lets you run and build Meteor apps without having to install the Meteor tool itself.

You can find the source code [at the main repository](https://git.larsvanherk.com/docker-images/meteor), along with [the CI pipelines.](https://git.larsvanherk.com/docker-images/meteor/pipelines)

## What can I do with Meteor?

Meteor is a tool used to quickly build web and mobile applications.

* The platform is based around JavaScript, in the front-end as well as in the back-end.  
* Data is passed reactively from the server to the clients, and vice-versa.

## How do I use the image?
