Meteor for Docker
=================

You can find this image on the [Docker Hub!](https://hub.docker.com/r/larsvh/meteor/)

This is a simple Meteor Docker image with support for live development and automated project building.

Built on the [NodeJS](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/) image, it lets you run and build Meteor apps without having to install the Meteor tool itself.
